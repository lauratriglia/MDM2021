In this folder you can find\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item action\+: contains the .action file {\itshape Pose.\+action}, needed to modify \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacego__to__point}{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point}} as an action server.
\item launch\+: contains the launch file {\itshape sim.\+launch}, that starts the simulation in a Gazebo environment.
\item scripts\+: contains two nodes implemented as python scripts that set the behaviour of the robot
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacego__to__point}{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point}}}\+: this is the action server that manage the robot speed control, depending on the goal received.
\item {\itshape \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceuser__interface}{user\+\_\+interface}}}\+: sends the request to start/stop the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacego__to__point}{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point}} behaviour asking to the user what the robot needs to do.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item src\+: contains two nodes implemented as cpp file that set the behaviour of the robot
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape position\+\_\+server}\+: it is the server that generates a random position.
\item {\itshape state\+\_\+machine}\+: manages the request of a new goal and it send the request as a goal to \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacego__to__point}{go\+\_\+to\+\_\+point}} action server.

After cloning the package, it is necessary to build the package in the path of your own workspace, with the command\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{catkin\_make}
\end{DoxyCode}


When the package is build successfully, you can run the .launch file to launch all the nodes and the Gazebo simulation\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch rt2\_assignment1 sim.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}
